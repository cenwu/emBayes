# emBayes

Variable selection methods have been extensively developed for analyzing high-dimensional omics data within both the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. This package implemented the spike-and-slab quantile LASSO which has been developed along the line of Bayesian hierarchical model but deeply rooted in the frequentist regularization methods by utilizing the Expectationâ€“Maximization (EM) algorithm. Therefore, the proposed method borrows strength from both the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks while overcoming their respective limitations. The spike-and-slab quantile LASSO can handle data irregularity in terms of skewness and outliers in the disease trait, compared to its nonrobust alternative, the spike-and-slab LASSO, which has also been implemented in the package. The core module of this package is developed in C++. 

## How to install

    - To install from Github, run these two lines of code in R

<!-- end list -->

    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("cenwu/emBayes")

  - Released versions of mixedBayes are available on CRAN
    [(link)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=emBayes), and can be
    installed within R via

<!-- end list -->

    install.packages("mixedBayes")

## Example

    library(emBayes)
    data(genes)
    ## Load the clinical factors, genetic factors, response and quantile data
    clin=genes$clin
    X=genes$X
    y=genes$y
    quant=genes$quant
    ## Generate tuning vectors of desired range
    t0 <- seq(0.01,0.015,length.out=2)
    t1 <- seq(0.1,0.5,length.out=2)
    ## Perform cross-validation and obtain tuning parameters based on check loss
    CV <- cv.emBayes(y,clin,X,quant,t0,t1,k=5,func="BQLSS",error=0.01,maxiter=2000)
    s0 <- CV$CL.s0
    s1 <- CV$CL.s1
    ## Perform BQLSS under optimal tuning and calculate value of TP and FP for selecting beta
    EM <- emBayes(y,clin,X,quant,s0,s1,func="BQLSS",error=0.01,maxiter=2000)
    fit <- EM$beta
    coef <- genes$coef
    tp <- sum(fit[coef!=0]!=0)
    fp <- sum(fit[coef==0]!=0)
    list(tp=tp,fp=fp)
