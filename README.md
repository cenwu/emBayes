# emBayes

Variable selection methods have been extensively developed for analyzing high-dimensional omics data within both the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. This package implemented the spike-and-slab quantile LASSO which has been developed along the line of Bayesian hierarchical model but deeply rooted in the frequentist regularization methods by utilizing the Expectationâ€“Maximization (EM) algorithm. Therefore, the proposed method borrows strength from both the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks while overcoming their respective limitations. The spike-and-slab quantile LASSO can handle data irregularity in terms of skewness and outliers in the disease trait, compared to its nonrobust alternative, the spike-and-slab LASSO, which has also been implemented in the package. The core module of this package is developed in C++. 

## How to install

    - To install from Github, run these two lines of code in R

<!-- end list -->

    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("cenwu/emBayes")

  - Released versions of emBayes are available on CRAN
    [(link)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=emBayes), and can be
    installed within R via

<!-- end list -->

    install.packages("emBayes")

## Example

     data(data)
     ##load the clinical factors, genetic factors, response and quantile data
     clin=data$clin
     X=data$X
     y=data$y
     quant=data$quant

     ##Specify tuning vectors of desired range
     t0 <- seq(0.01,0.015,length.out=2)
     t1 <- seq(0.1,0.5,length.out=2)

     ##Perform cross-validation and obtain tuning parameters based on check loss
     CV <- cv.emBayes(y,clin,X,quant,t0,t1,k=5,func="ssQLASSO",error=0.01,maxiter=200)
     s0 <- CV$CL.s0
     s1 <- CV$CL.s1

     ##Perform ssQLASSO under optimal tuning and calculate value of TP and FP for selecting beta
     EM <- emBayes(y,clin,X,quant,s0,s1,func="ssQLASSO",error=0.01,maxiter=200)
     fit <- EM$beta
     coef <- data$coef
     tp <- sum(fit[coef!=0]!=0)
     fp <- sum(fit[coef==0]!=0)
     list(tp=tp,fp=fp)
